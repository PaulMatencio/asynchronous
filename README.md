# Asynchronous request and Promise

This repos contains the solution  of the [Udacity's Ajax course]()  [https://www.udacity.com/course/asynchronous-javascript-requests--ud109]
It adds javascript Promise to wrap (and chain) XHR Object and Fetch API
The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

## Asynchronous request ( part of the course)

* the XHR object [async-w-fetch]
* jQuery's `.ajax()` method [async-w-jQuery]
* the Fetch API    [asynch-w-fetch]
